# Avogadro 2 Input Generators

Introduction

This repository contains the Python input generators that
can be run by the Avogadro 2 application to generate input
for various codes:

- NWChem
- Gaussian
- MOPAC
- Orca
- Q-Chem
- Dalton
- GAMESS-UK
- Psi4
- (etc.)

Pull requests, bug reports, new codes, and feature suggestions are most welcome.

Installing
----------

These scripts need to be installed in a location where the Avogadro 2
application can find them, for example the "Plugin Downloader" feature.

You should fork the repository on GitHub, and submit a pull request for new
input generators. We encourage you to discuss any new generators on our
development list.
